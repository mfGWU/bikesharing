Create data analysis on New York City Bike Share program to help draw up a business plan for Des Moines Bike Share Program.

Module 14 Challenge Report for the Final Presentation
Overview of the statistical analysis:
The story board and final report will be used to convince investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa is a solid business proposal after gathering and analyzing the data from New York City (NYC) bike trip data.  Tableau was leverage to create the story board for the presentation.
Results:
The story board consist of ten pages and the bullets below describe the result of the visualization. Subscribers and customers are type of users.
•	Page one consists of different breakdown of the total numbers of trips by user type, gender breakdown for the month of August 2019.  It also includes average trip duration by birth year of the rider.  81% of the user type are subscribers and 65% of the bike riders are males.
•	Page three is a heatmap of riders which breaks down the count between genders and unknown riders, type of users, and the day and time of the week they use the service.
•	Page four is a bar graph of total hours when the riders use the service without gender or type break down of riders. 
•	Page five is similar to the previous page but this graph allows the audience or the presenter to filter by the hour of the day to drill down specific hour to find out the total count of riders and how long the riders use the service.
•	Page six similar to Page five containing the same set of data point but the gender separation display is pronounced and allows both the audience and the presenter to drill down by hour, and by gender.  
•	Pages Seven and Eight are maps of starting and ending stations where riders can pick up or drop off their bikes.  The density of station with the largest count is represented by larger circle with darker shade of red color.  The same size and coloring is represented in Page Eight where the bikes are dropped off after the riders completed their journey.   
•	Page Nine is a heatmap of rider type with a breakdown of days of the week and gender type. In this chart user and gender type can be filtered to drill down to specific set of data.
•	Page Ten consist of tree map and bubble plot account total trip duration and total number each bike is checked out.  With these two charts could track the upkeep and plan which bikes can be maintained on a regular basis.

Summary:
The story board provided an analysis of NYC busiest month bike sharing data.  Different visualizations provided utilization breakdowns by gender, type of users, hours and days of bike usage, and popular stations where the bikes checked out and dropped off.  Subscriber customers and male riders utilized the service the most while the younger riders are also using the service the most.  Some hours in the morning and early evening Monday through Friday, we see consistent spike of riders.  It could be either the riders are heading to/from work or on their exercise.  On Saturday and Sundays, from 7:00 AM till 8:00PM there is consistent riding and it could from subscriber running errands, or customers who are visiting the city.  This summary could help target which areas and population distribution to target when comparing data between NYC and Des Moines to see if the business is viable.
To put together a better business, add the following visualizations:
•	Add another visualizations of which type of bike renters are checking out/in from the most to least popular stations.
•	Compare this same analyses with other months in the same year and the simulation of the same analyses for the same month in previous years, provide the fee schedule for the whole year and cost of maintenance.
•	Compare the population distribution between
